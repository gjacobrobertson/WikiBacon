This is where I keep the Wikipedia dump files. I didn't commit them because they are gigantic.

You can get a copy from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#English-language_Wikipedia. This program currently expects to only encounter the current revision, so make sure to get the "Current revisions only" version.
